1)Understanding the Dataset Columns: id: Unique identifier for each listing. name: Name of the Airbnb listing. host_id: Unique identifier for the host. neighbourhood_group: The broader area (e.g., Manhattan, Brooklyn). latitude and longitude: Geographic coordinates of the property. room_type: Type of room (Entire home/apt, Private room, etc.). price: Price per night in USD. number_of_reviews: Total reviews received by the listing. availability_365: Number of days per year the property is available.
2)Data Cleaning Handle missing data: Check for any missing or null values, especially in important columns like price or reviews. Fill or drop missing values depending on the data distribution. Outlier detection: Look for price outliers. Some listings may have extremely high or low prices that donâ€™t align with the market and could skew your analysis.
